 Contains the exercises developed during the course. 
 Here is a summary of what I've been learning every week
 
 

##### Week 1: Initialization & Inspiration 
 
 * Research and thinking: which systems in nature do work though the use of recursion, apart from trees
 * use of Terminal
 * Github: repo, pull, push, github desktop
 * X-Code
 
##### Week 2: Leaves:

*  learn how to create and initialize classes and arrays. 
*  use of vertex to create custom shapes
*  learnt how to read and analyze the OF examples to combine them with my projects.
* passing variables
* for loops
* functions
* link h and cpp files

##### Week 3: Branch:

* recursion
* rotation (PI)
* passing variables
* add flowers

##### Week 4: Tree:

* recursion
* managing complex structure and links to be nonnected and called one inside another
* visuals refining through personalization of rotation, angle, curvature, color, arrays dimensions and shapes.
* key pressed

Tree completed with sesasons, leaves, branches and flowers.

* Create Readme and modifiy with Mow
