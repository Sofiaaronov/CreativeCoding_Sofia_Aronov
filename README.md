# CreativeCoding_oF_F15_Sofia_Aronov
 
 Contains the exercises developed during the course. 
 Here is a summary of what I've been learning every week
 
 

##### Week 1: Initialization & Inspiration 
 
 * Research and thinking: which systems in nature do work though the use of recursion, apart from trees
 * use of Terminal
 * Github: repo, pull, push, github desktop
 * X-Code
 
##### Week 2: Leaves:

*  learn how to create and initialize classes and arrays. 
*  use of vertex to create custom shapes
*  learnt how to read and analyze the OF examples to combine them with my projects.
* passing variables
* for loops
* functions
* link h and cpp files

##### Week 3: Branch:

* recursion
* rotation (PI)
* passing variables
* add flowers

##### Week 4: Tree:

* recursion
* managing complex structure and links to be nonnected and called one inside another
* visuals refining through personalization of rotation, angle, curvature, color, arrays dimensions and shapes.
* key pressed

Tree completed with sesasons, leaves, branches and flowers.

* Create Readme and modifiy with Mow

##### Week 6: Fireworks

* Physics: velocity and acceleration
* Radial movement (cos and sin)
* transparency and trail illusion
* Gravity simulation


##### Week 9: Water Cycle

For my final experimentation with animation and interactitiy it Has been my intention to recreate a "water cycle" using particles and approaching the ofxBox2d addon to draw colliders (foder "Water2", attempt which eventually failed: I'd like to carry on on this path and make it work)).

Here is a rendering plan of the dynamics of the water particles, which is working in folder "Water1").

* Physics: acceleration, velocity, bounciness
* Interaction: mousePressed
* Booleans and conditionals expressions
* ofxBox2d: colliders
